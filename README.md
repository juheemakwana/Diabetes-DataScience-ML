# Diabetes-DataScience-ML
This repository focuses on diabetes prediction using health indicator datasets. It includes data preprocessing, EDA, feature selection, handling imbalanced data, and building ML models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, and Random Forest, with techniques like SMOTE and ANOVA for feature optimization.

# Key Steps and Features:
PART-I
## Data Cleaning:

Renaming and formatting feature names for readability.

Creating binary datasets for "Diabetes" vs. "No Diabetes."

Saving processed datasets, including a 50-50 balanced binary dataset, to CSV.

PART-II
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identifying trends, distributions, and correlations in the data.
Feature Selection and Engineering:

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis for multicollinearity.
ANOVA for feature importance and selection.
Identifying the best features for predictive modeling.

## Data Splitting and Imbalance Handling:

Splitting data into training and testing sets.
Addressing class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE and NearMiss.

## Data Scaling:

Standardizing features for consistent model performance.
Modeling and Evaluation:

Implementation of various machine learning models, including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest
Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
